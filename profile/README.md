# Accessibe City / Bessere Radwege

This is a common organization for the "Bessere Radwege" ([www.bessere-radwege.de](https://www.bessere-radwege.de)) and "Accessible City" ([www.accessible-city.de](https://www.accessible-city.de)) projects. Both gather everyday commute data of humans (humans on bicycles, humans in wheelchairs), collect them in an anonymous way and try to find insights about city infrastructure in order to improve it for all citizens.

Both projects were funded by the "un:box Cologne" project ([unbox.cologne](https://unbox.cologne)). For more information about the projects themselves, please visit their respective app's repositories or visit their home pages.
